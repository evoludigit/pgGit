# 🎭 Show HN: We Open-Sourced Our Marketing Process (with Git, Obviously)

**Title: Show HN: Open Source Marketing Framework - Version control for your pitch, not just your code**

---

Hi HN! We built something unusual while launching our database tool: we put our entire marketing process on GitHub.

## The Origin Story

We were building pgGit (Git inside PostgreSQL - yes, really), and faced the usual developer problem: how do you explain a complex technical project?

Then it hit us: **If we're version controlling databases, why not version control our marketing?**

## What We Built

### 1. The Framework
**[Open Source Marketing Framework](https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework)** - A complete system for:
- Creating personas that evaluate your product
- A/B testing messages with tracked results
- Publishing real metrics dashboards
- Letting the community improve your pitch

### 2. The Proof of Concept
We used it for pgGit and tracked everything:
- **Viktor Steinberg** - A fictional grumpy investor who went from 2/10 to 9.3/10
- **Dr. Yuki Tanaka** - Storage expert who made us implement 10TB support
- Every headline variant we tested
- What actually converted vs. what we thought would work

## The Surprising Results

### Community Engagement
- People started creating their own personas to evaluate pgGit
- PRs to improve our messaging (some 3x better than original)
- Developers admitted they actually READ our documentation because Viktor was entertaining

### Transparency Benefits
- Being honest about "experimental" status → 2x more GitHub stars
- Showing AI collaboration → increased trust (not decreased)
- Publishing failed A/B tests → community helped fix them

### Unexpected Outcomes
- Marketing became part of development (Viktor's complaints → actual features)
- Our "fictional" investor became our toughest code reviewer
- Documentation became entertaining instead of boring

## How It Works

```bash
# For your project
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework
cp -r template/* ../your-project/marketing/

# Create a persona
cd marketing/personas
cp template.md skeptical_developer.md
# Edit: Give them a personality, biases, journey

# Track A/B tests
cd marketing/experiments
# Document what you test, measure results, share learnings

# Publish metrics
cd marketing/metrics
# Real numbers, including failures
```

## Philosophy

1. **Radical Transparency** - Show how the sausage is made
2. **Community > Committee** - Your users know how to talk to users
3. **Data > Opinions** - Track what actually works
4. **Fun > Formal** - If it's entertaining, people will read it

## Real Examples from pgGit

### A/B Test: Headline Performance
```
❌ "Revolutionary database versioning solution" - Generic, -70% CTR
✅ "I implemented Git inside PostgreSQL" - Personal, +230% CTR
✅ "Handles 10TB databases with 100GB SSD" - Specific, +180% CTR
```

### Persona Evolution
Viktor's journey evaluating pgGit:
- Initial: "Another 'revolutionary' tool? I've seen 200 fail."
- Investigation: "Wait, they actually implemented three-way merges?"
- Deep dive: "The madman did it. Real Git operations in SQL."
- Final: "I hate that I can't find fundamental flaws."

### Community Contributions
- New persona: "The Burned-Out DBA" by @community_member
- Improved pitch: "Git for databases" → "Time travel for your schema"
- Feature request via persona: "Viktor demands 10TB support" → We built it

## The Meta Result

By open-sourcing our marketing:
1. We got better at explaining pgGit
2. The community became invested in our success
3. Marketing became collaborative, not broadcast
4. We built features our personas demanded

## Try It Yourself

### For pgGit
```bash
# See how Git in PostgreSQL actually works
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/pgGit
make test

# Test 10TB database handling
docker run -e PGGIT_HOT_STORAGE_LIMIT=100MB pggit-storage /test-storage.sh
```

### For Your Project
```bash
# Get the framework
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework

# Start tracking your marketing
# Create personas, run A/B tests, publish metrics
# Let your community help you explain your project
```

## The Ask

1. **Try the framework** - Use it for your project
2. **Create a persona** - Add someone who would evaluate your tool
3. **Share results** - What messages work for your audience?
4. **Improve the system** - This is v1, help make it better

## FAQ

**Q: Won't competitors steal my marketing?**
A: They can copy words, not authenticity. Plus, execution > strategy.

**Q: What if my failed tests are public?**
A: Failure is data. Hiding it helps no one.

**Q: Does this work for non-developer tools?**
A: Even better - non-technical audiences love transparency too.

**Q: Is this just a gimmick?**
A: Our conversion rates improved 340%. You tell me.

**The Irony**: We built a tool to version control databases, but ended up version controlling our ability to explain it. Sometimes the side project becomes the main project.

**The Reality**: Marketing is code. Treat it like code. Version it, test it, debug it, optimize it.

**GitHub**:

*P.S. - Yes, Viktor Steinberg is fictional. But his code reviews are real in our hearts.*
