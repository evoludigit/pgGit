# ðŸŽ­ Open Source Marketing Framework

> Version control for your marketing, not just your code

## What is this?

A framework for open-sourcing your entire marketing process. Track what works, share what doesn't, and let your community help you find the perfect pitch.

Born from the [pgGit](https://github.com/evoludigit/pgGit) project, where we realized: if we can version control databases, why not version control our marketing?

## Why Open Source Your Marketing?

1. **Transparency builds trust** - Show exactly how you position your product
2. **Community knows best** - Your users often explain your product better than you do
3. **A/B test everything** - Track what messages resonate
4. **Learn from failures** - Failed campaigns become learning opportunities
5. **Collaborative creativity** - Let others contribute personas, pitches, and strategies

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opensource-marketing-framework
cd opensource-marketing-framework

# Copy the template structure to your project
cp -r template/* ../your-project/marketing/

# Start tracking your marketing
cd ../your-project
git add marketing/
git commit -m "feat: Open source our marketing process"
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Personas
Create fictional characters who evaluate your product from different angles:
- The Skeptical Investor
- The Overworked Developer  
- The Security Auditor
- The Penny-Pinching CTO

Each persona has opinions, biases, and specific things that convince them.

### 2. Assessment Journey
Document how each persona's opinion evolves:
- Initial reaction (usually negative)
- Investigation process
- Moments of surprise
- Final verdict

### 3. Message Testing
Track every variant of your pitch:
- What you tested
- Who you tested it on
- What the results were
- What you learned

### 4. Metrics-Driven
Everything is measurable:
- Engagement rates
- Conversion rates
- Message effectiveness
- Channel performance

## Example: pgGit's Open Marketing

pgGit open-sourced their entire marketing process, including:

- **Viktor Steinberg**: A grumpy investor persona who went from 2/10 to 9.3/10
- **Dr. Yuki Tanaka**: Storage expert who challenged scalability  
- **HN Launch Story**: Multiple versions with tracked performance
- **A/B Tests**: Headlines, descriptions, CTAs with real metrics

Result: Community contributed new personas, improved messaging, and helped identify what resonated.

## Getting Started with Your Project

### Step 1: Create Your First Persona

```bash
cd marketing/personas
cp templates/persona_template.md skeptical_developer.md
# Edit with your persona's details
```

### Step 2: Write Their Assessment

```bash
cd marketing/assessments
cp templates/assessment_template.md skeptical_developer_assessment.md
# Document their journey evaluating your product
```

### Step 3: Test Your First Message

```bash
cd marketing/experiments
cp templates/ab_test_template.md 001_headline_test.md
# Document what you're testing and why
```

### Step 4: Track Results

```bash
cd marketing/metrics
# Update dashboard.md with real metrics
# Be honest about what worked and what didn't
```
