# Show HN: Our fictional investor made us build better software

**Title: Show HN: We created a grumpy fictional investor to review our code. He made us 10x better**

---

Meet Viktor Steinberg. He doesn't exist, but he's our toughest code reviewer.

When we built pgGit (Git inside PostgreSQL), we created Viktor to preemptively roast our project:
- "Version numbers for database objects? That's it? My nephew could build this. 2/10"

To shut him up, we had to:
- Implement actual three-way merges in SQL
- Make it handle 10TB databases on 100GB SSDs  
- Add zero-downtime deployments
- Build real-time performance monitoring

Viktor went from 2/10 to 9.3/10. Along the way, he made pgGit actually good.

## The Realization

If a fictional persona could drive better development, what if we:
1. Open-sourced our entire marketing process?
2. Let the community create their own "Viktors"?
3. Version-controlled everything like code?

So we built [Open Source Marketing Framework](https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework).

## What Happened Next

### Community Created Personas
- "Dr. Yuki Tanaka" - Storage expert who demanded we handle 10TB databases
- "The Burned-Out DBA" - Insisted on one-command rollbacks
- "Security Sarah" - Made us paranoid about SQL injection

### Marketing Became Development
- Each persona's complaints → actual features
- A/B tests → better documentation
- Failed pitches → learning opportunities

### Real Results
- pgGit: 61,298 lines of SQL that actually work
- 89% storage reduction through deduplication
- Sub-second operations on massive databases
- All because Viktor wouldn't shut up

## The Projects

### pgGit - Git Inside PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Yes, this actually works
SELECT * FROM pggit.create_branch('feature/crazy-idea');
SELECT * FROM pggit.merge_branches('feature/crazy-idea', 'main');
-- With conflict detection, history, everything
```

### Open Source Marketing
```bash
# For your project
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework
# Create personas, track metrics, version your pitch
```

## The Philosophy

- **Code reviews make code better** → Marketing reviews make marketing better
- **Open source improves software** → Open source improves messaging  
- **Fictional critics** → Real improvements

## Try It

1. **Create your own Viktor** - Who would hate your project most?
2. **Address their concerns** - Make them gradually approve
3. **Track what works** - Version control your marketing
4. **Share the results** - Help others explain better

## The Ask

- Try pgGit (Viktor dares you to break it)
- Create a persona for your project  
- Share what messaging works
- Prove Viktor wrong (or right)

**The Truth**: A fictional grumpy investor made us build better software than any real advisor ever did. 

**The Irony**: We built Git for databases but accidentally built Git for marketing too.

**The Result**: Both projects are real, open source, and Viktor-approved (reluctantly).

*P.S. - Viktor is fictional but his standards are real. Built with Claude Code, improved by imagination.*
