## Next Steps

### Option A: Start Week 9 Immediately
```bash
cd /home/lionel/code/pggit

# Review the plan
cat WEEK_9_REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION.md | head -50

# Review the QA results
cat WEEK_9_QA_REMEDIATION_COMPLETE.md | head -30

# Begin Day 1 tasks
# (Follow the plan for daily guidance)
```

### Option B: Review First, Then Execute
```bash
# 1. Read the complete plan
less WEEK_9_REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION.md

# 2. Review gap remediations
less WEEK_9_QA_REMEDIATION_COMPLETE.md

# 3. Review QA assessment
less WEEK_9_QA_REVIEW.md

# 4. Start Week 9 implementation
```

### Option C: Validate Completeness
```bash
# Verify all required files exist
ls -lh RELEASING.md SUPPORT.md DEPLOYMENT.md ARCHIVE_README_TEMPLATE.md
ls -lh WEEK_9_REPOSITORY_REORGANIZATION.md WEEK_9_FILE_DISPOSITION_MATRIX.md
ls -lh WEEK_9_QA_REVIEW.md WEEK_9_QA_REMEDIATION_COMPLETE.md

# Review git commits
git log --oneline -5
```

## FAQ

**Q: Are the documentation files (RELEASING.md, etc.) final?**
A: They're provided as templates and ready to use. Feel free to customize for your specific needs. All are production-quality.

**Q: When should I archive the Week 9 planning documents?**
A: Flexibility: Day 3 after root cleanup OR Day 5 after verification. Either timing creates a complete historical record.

**Q: What if something doesn't match the plan during execution?**
A: Flexibility is built in. Document the deviation and adjust. The plan is a guide, not a rigid blueprint.

**Q: Can I start with specific days instead of sequentially?**
A: Days 1-2 can overlap. Days 3-5 should follow sequence. Day 5 must be last.

**Q: How do I verify everything worked correctly?**
A: Use the checklist provided in Day 5 of the plan. All 10 items should pass.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: No problem. Git preserves everything. You can revert commits or restore files.
