  # CodeQL scanning disabled: pgGit is a PostgreSQL extension (SQL/Python only)
  # CodeQL v3 does not support SQL as a standalone language for analysis
  # Trivy scanning (filesystem vulnerability scanning) is sufficient for this project

  # dependency-review disabled: requires GitHub Advanced Security features
  # This repository does not have GitHub Advanced Security enabled
  # Alternative: Use Trivy scanning for vulnerability detection (already enabled above)
