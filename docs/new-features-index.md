# pgGit New Features Documentation

This documentation covers the comprehensive new features added to pgGit to support enterprise architectures, particularly addressing requirements from complex CQRS systems, microservices, and traditional migration tool integration.

## Feature Documentation

### 🎛️ [Configuration System](configuration-system.md)
Fine-grained control over what pgGit tracks, including:
- Selective schema tracking
- Operation filtering  
- Deployment mode for batching changes
- Comment-based directives
- Emergency pause/resume controls

**Key Use Case**: Perfect for CQRS architectures where you want to track command schemas but ignore query side refreshes.

### 🏗️ [CQRS Support](cqrs-support.md)
Built-in support for Command Query Responsibility Segregation patterns:
- Coordinated change tracking across command and query sides
- Atomic changesets spanning multiple schemas
- Dependency analysis between models
- Query side synchronization helpers

**Key Use Case**: Managing complex domain models with separate read/write concerns while maintaining consistency.

### 🔧 [Function Versioning](function-versioning.md)
Advanced function tracking with full overload support:
- Signature-based tracking (not just names)
- Automatic semantic versioning
- Metadata extraction from comments
- Function history and comparison

**Key Use Case**: SQL-first development where functions contain critical business logic and need proper version control.

### 🚀 [Migration Integration](migration-integration.md)
Seamless integration with traditional migration tools:
- Flyway and Liquibase auto-tracking
- Migration validation and gap detection
- Impact analysis for changes
- Unified history across tools

**Key Use Case**: Teams using existing migration tools who want pgGit's advanced features without changing workflows.

### ⚡ [Conflict Resolution & Operations](conflict-resolution-and-operations.md)
User-friendly conflict resolution and operational controls:
- Simple API for resolving conflicts
- Emergency disable functionality
- Maintenance operations (purge, consistency checks)
- Performance monitoring and reporting

**Key Use Case**: Production environments requiring careful control and the ability to handle emergency situations.

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Configure for Microservices

```sql
-- Each service owns its schemas
SELECT pggit.configure_tracking(
    track_schemas => ARRAY['user_service', 'order_service', 'payment_service'],
    ignore_schemas => ARRAY['public', 'monitoring', 'audit_logs'],
    ignore_operations => ARRAY['REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW', 'REINDEX']
);
```

### Example 2: CQRS Implementation

```sql
-- Track a complete CQRS change
SELECT pggit.track_cqrs_change(
    ROW(
        ARRAY['ALTER TABLE command.orders ADD COLUMN priority text'],
        ARRAY['DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW query.order_summary',
              'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW query.order_summary AS ...'],
        'Add order priority feature',
        '2.1.0'
    )::pggit.cqrs_change
);
```

### Example 3: Deployment Workflow

```sql
-- Start deployment
SELECT pggit.begin_deployment('Q1 2024 Release');

-- Make your changes...
CREATE TABLE ...;
ALTER TABLE ...;

-- Track function updates
SELECT pggit.track_function('api.process_order(jsonb)', '3.0.0');

-- Complete deployment
SELECT pggit.end_deployment('Q1 release completed successfully');
```

### Example 4: Emergency Situation

```sql
-- Something's wrong, disable tracking
SELECT pggit.emergency_disable('1 hour'::interval);

-- Fix the issue...

-- Re-enable when safe
SELECT pggit.emergency_enable();
```

## Integration with Existing pgGit Features

These new features integrate seamlessly with pgGit's existing capabilities:

- **Branching**: Configuration is branch-specific
- **Merging**: CQRS changesets participate in three-way merges
- **History**: All features contribute to unified history
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with configuration options

## Migration from Workarounds

If you've been using workarounds like:
- Temporarily disabling triggers
- Manual deployment scripts
- Custom tracking tables
- Separate migration logs

You can now replace them with native pgGit features that provide better integration and safety.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Configuration**: Set up tracking rules before making changes
2. **Use Deployment Mode**: For production releases and multi-step changes
3. **Document Functions**: Use comment metadata for better tracking
4. **Validate Migrations**: Check sequence integrity regularly
5. **Monitor Performance**: Use the built-in reporting tools

## Support and Feedback

These features were developed in response to real-world requirements from production systems. If you have additional needs or feedback:

1. Check the individual feature documentation for detailed examples
2. Review the test suites for usage patterns
3. Submit issues or enhancement requests

## Compatibility

- PostgreSQL 17+ (tested and optimized)
- PostgreSQL 15-16 (should work with minor adjustments)
- Works alongside existing pgGit installations
- Backward compatible with existing pgGit data
