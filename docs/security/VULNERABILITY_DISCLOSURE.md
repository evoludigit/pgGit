# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Overview

pgGit takes security seriously. This document outlines our vulnerability disclosure policy and responsible disclosure process.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in pgGit, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, send security reports to: `security@pgGit.dev` (placeholder - configure actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fixes (if any)

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates on our progress (at least weekly)
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you request anonymity)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy

## Vulnerability Handling Process

1. **Report Received**: Acknowledge within 48 hours
2. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact within 1 week
3. **Fix Development**: Develop and test fix
4. **Security Advisory**: Publish coordinated disclosure
5. **Fix Release**: Release patched version

## Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, SQL injection, privilege escalation
- **High**: Data exposure, denial of service, authentication bypass

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow industry-standard coordinated disclosure:
- Critical/High: 90 days from report to public disclosure
