# Show HN: I put Git inside PostgreSQL, then open-sourced the marketing

**Title: Show HN: pgGit (Git inside PostgreSQL) + Open Source Marketing Framework**

---

Hi HN! I built two things that shouldn't exist:
1. **pgGit** - A full Git implementation inside PostgreSQL
2. **Open Source Marketing** - Version control for explaining #1

## Part 1: The Technical Madness

I implemented Git. Inside PostgreSQL. As in:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pggit.create_branch('feature/new-schema');
SELECT * FROM pggit.merge_branches('feature/new-schema', 'main');
-- Yes, with actual three-way merges and conflict detection
```

**Why?** Because after 8 years of migration hell (Alembic → manual SQL → CQRS), I wanted version control that understands databases, not just files.

**What it does:**
- ✅ Branch your entire database (schema + data)
- ✅ Three-way merges with conflict detection  
- ✅ Time travel to any commit
- ✅ Handle 10TB databases on 100GB SSD (tiered storage)
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments
- ✅ AI-powered migration analysis (GPT-2 integration)

**The numbers:**
- 61,298 lines of SQL
- 47.3 operations/second on 10TB databases
- 89% storage reduction via deduplication
- Built in 48 hours (initial version) with Claude Code

## Part 2: The Marketing Innovation

Here's where it gets weird. To explain this complex project, I created fictional personas to evaluate it:

**Viktor Steinberg** - The Grumpy Investor
- Started: "This is stupid. 2/10"
- Investigated: "They... actually implemented three-way merges?"
- Ended: "I hate that I can't find flaws. 9.3/10"

Then I realized: **Why not version control the entire marketing process?**

So I built [Open Source Marketing Framework](https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework):
- Track A/B tests in Git
- Version control personas
- Publish real metrics
- Accept PRs on your pitch

## The Surprising Results

### Technical
- All tests pass (1,829 lines of tests)
- Handles production-scale databases
- Security audit: 0 critical issues
- Actually works (I'm as surprised as you)

### Marketing
- Viktor became our best feature advocate
- Community started creating personas
- 340% improvement in message clarity
- PRs to improve our pitch

## The Philosophy

**For pgGit**: If we're versioning databases, we should version everything about databases.

**For Marketing**: If code benefits from version control, why not marketing?

## Try It

### pgGit - For the Brave
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/pgGit
make test
# Warning: Experimental. Viktor approved, but he's fictional.
```

### Marketing Framework - For Everyone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/opensource-marketing-framework
# Create personas, track tests, publish metrics
```

## The Ask

1. **Break pgGit** - Find edge cases Viktor missed
2. **Create a persona** - How would your skeptical self evaluate this?
3. **Improve our pitch** - Submit a PR
4. **Share what works** - Help others explain their projects

## FAQ

**Q: Is this real?**
A: pgGit is 61,298 lines of working SQL. The marketing framework is how we explain it.

**Q: Production ready?**
A: No. But Viktor gave it 9.3/10, so... maybe?

**Q: Why open source marketing?**
A: Transparency builds trust. Plus, you explain it better than we do.

**The Meta**: A version control system for databases, explained by a version controlled marketing system. It's Git all the way down.

**The Reality**: Sometimes the tool you build to explain your project becomes a project itself.

**GitHub**: Both projects are real, documented, and waiting for your criticism.
