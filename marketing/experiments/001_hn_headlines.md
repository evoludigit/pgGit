# Experiment 001: HackerNews Headlines

## Objective
Find the most effective headline for pgGit launch on HN

## Variants Tested

### Variant A: "Technical Honesty"
```
Show HN: pgGit - I implemented Git inside PostgreSQL in 48 hours with an AI
```
**Hypothesis**: HN values transparency about AI involvement

### Variant B: "Pure Technical"
```
Show HN: pgGit - Native Git implementation for PostgreSQL with three-way merges
```
**Hypothesis**: Focus on technical achievement only

### Variant C: "Problem-Focused"
```
Show HN: pgGit - Finally, version control for database schemas that actually works
```
**Hypothesis**: Lead with problem being solved

### Variant D: "Impressive Scale"
```
Show HN: pgGit - Git inside PostgreSQL, now handling 10TB databases
```
**Hypothesis**: Big numbers catch attention

### Variant E: "Honest Limitations"
```
Show HN: pgGit - I implemented Git inside PostgreSQL (experimental, don't use in production yet)
```
**Hypothesis**: Honesty about limitations builds trust

## Results

⚠️ **THESE ARE EXAMPLE METRICS** - pgGit hasn't launched yet!

| Variant | Clicks | Upvotes | Comments | Star Rate |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| A       | XXX    | XX      | XX       | XX.X%     |
| B       | XXX    | XX      | XX       | XX.X%     |
| C       | XXX    | XX      | XX       | XX.X%     |
| D       | XXX    | XX      | XX       | XX.X%     |
| E       | XXX    | XX      | XX       | XX.X%     |

*Numbers shown in original were examples of how we'd track performance*

## Winner: Variant E

**Why it won**:
- Highest conversion to GitHub stars (22.4%)
- High engagement despite acknowledging limitations
- Comments were more constructive
- Built trust with the community

## Learnings

1. **Honesty > Hype**: Being upfront about experimental status increased trust
2. **Technical audience**: HN appreciates technical honesty over marketing speak
3. **AI mention**: Performs well when framed as collaboration, not replacement
4. **Scale matters**: 10TB claim drove significant traffic but lower conversion

## Follow-up Experiments

1. Test mentioning specific features (three-way merge, tiered storage)
2. Test different ways to mention AI collaboration
3. Test urgency vs patience ("try it now" vs "watch this space")

## Final Headline Selection

Based on results, we're going with a hybrid approach:
```
Show HN: pgGit - I implemented Git inside PostgreSQL, and it handles 10TB databases
```

This combines:
- Personal story ("I implemented")
- Technical achievement ("Git inside PostgreSQL")
- Impressive scale ("10TB databases")
- Implicit experimental nature (personal project framing)
