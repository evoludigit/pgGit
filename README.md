# pggit: Git for PostgreSQL Databases üöÄ

**Git-like version control for PostgreSQL schemas. Track, branch, and manage database changes like code.**

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install pggit
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/pggit.git
cd pggit
make && sudo make install

# Use it
psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION pggit"
psql -c "CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)"
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pggit.get_version('users')"  # Version 1.0.0!
```

## What if your database could branch like your code?

You know that moment when you're staring at a production database after a deployment, wondering "What changed? Who changed it? And please tell me there's a way back?" We've all been there.

**pggit solves this by bringing Git-like version control to PostgreSQL databases.**

## üéØ What Makes This Revolutionary

### Not Just Schema Tracking - Actual Database Git

Everyone else tracks migrations. We've built **actual Git workflows inside PostgreSQL**:

- **üåø Native Branching**: Create isolated database branches with real data
- **üîÄ Three-Way Merging**: Intelligent conflict resolution for schema and data changes  
- **üíæ Efficient Storage**: PostgreSQL 17 compression enables practical data branching
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Optimized for speed with minimal overhead
- **üîÑ Copy-on-Write**: Branch data without exploding storage costs

### The "Finally!" Moment for Database DevOps

```sql
-- Monday: Create a feature branch with actual data
SELECT pggit.create_data_branch('feature/user-profiles', 'main', true);

-- Tuesday: Make breaking changes safely
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;
INSERT INTO users (name, avatar_url) VALUES ('Test User', 'test.jpg');

-- Wednesday: Merge back to main with zero conflicts
SELECT pggit.merge_compressed_branches('feature/user-profiles', 'main');
-- Result: 'MERGE_SUCCESS' + automatic compression optimization
```

## üöÄ Everything Included (No Premium Gates)

### Database Branching (Finally Real)

- **Schema Branching**: Independent DDL changes per branch
- **Data Branching**: Copy-on-write data isolation using PostgreSQL inheritance
- **Branch Views**: Automatic query routing to branch-specific data
- **Storage Efficiency**: Compression technology reduces storage overhead

### Intelligent Merging  

- **Three-Way Conflict Detection**: Compare base, source, and target branches
- **Automatic Resolution**: Smart defaults for non-conflicting changes
- **Manual Override**: Clean UI for resolving complex conflicts
- **Compression-Aware**: Optimize storage during merge operations

### PostgreSQL 17 Native Integration

- **LZ4/ZSTD Compression**: Native PostgreSQL 17 compression support
- **Event Triggers**: Real-time change capture with zero configuration
- **JSONB Optimization**: Column-level compression for efficient storage
- **Performance**: Optimized I/O with compressed storage

### AI-Powered Migration Analysis

- **PostgreSQL-Native AI**: Built-in heuristic analysis with pattern learning
- **Real-time Analysis**: Fast migration risk assessment
- **High Confidence**: Reliable accuracy for common migration patterns
- **Edge Case Detection**: Automatic flagging of high-risk operations
- **100% Privacy**: All analysis happens in your PostgreSQL instance
- **GPT-2 Ready**: Optional integration with local LLMs for enhanced analysis

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install pggit (2 minutes)

```bash
# For PostgreSQL 17 (with compression support)
git clone https://github.com/evoludigit/pggit.git
cd pggit
sudo make install

# Create extension
psql -d your_database -c "CREATE EXTENSION pggit CASCADE;"
```

### 2. Your First Database Branch (30 seconds)

```sql
-- Initialize pggit on your database
SELECT pggit.init();

-- Create your first branch
SELECT pggit.create_branch('feature/new-ui');

-- Make changes safely
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN theme VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'dark';

-- See what changed
SELECT * FROM pggit.status();

-- Merge back when ready
SELECT pggit.merge('feature/new-ui', 'main');
```

### 3. Time Travel Through Your Database

```sql
-- See all database versions
SELECT * FROM pggit.log();

-- Checkout any point in time
SELECT pggit.checkout('3 hours ago');

-- Or checkout specific commit
SELECT pggit.checkout('abc123def');
```
